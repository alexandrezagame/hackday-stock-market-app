# hackday-crypto-app

A one day project where I use the Coin Gecko api to fetch the 100 coins with the highest MKT Cap. 
Price updates happen every 5 seconds (limit set to 100 requests per minute). 
In this app I have also chosen to display the price difference over 24hrs and over 1year. 
But as well display the investment value of someone having invested 1K$ 1 year ago.
